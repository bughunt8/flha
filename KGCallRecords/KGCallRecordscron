# KG 18-Feb-19 Execute the KGCallRecords.sh script at nominated times.
#              (typically weekly, early Monday morning)
#
# SUPER IMPORTANT!!!
# 1) Every entry MUST end with a newline, including the last. So make sure the last entry is followed by a blank line.
# 2) File ownership and permissions must be as per other cron files in this folder.

# USEFUL WAY TO TEST THE SCRIPT: Execute every minute, redirect output to text files in /home/konnekt.
#  m  h  dom mon dow  user      command
#  *  *    *   *   *  konnekt   /home/konnekt/Downloads/CallRecords/KGCallRecords.sh > KGCR.txt 2> KGCRE.txt

# THE ACTUAL CRON ENTRY: Execute every Monday at 4am.
#  m  h  dom mon dow  user      command
   0  4    *   *   1  konnekt   /home/konnekt/Downloads/CallRecords/KGCallRecords.sh
