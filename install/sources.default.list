# Konnekt .deb Repository

# KG 09-MAR-16
# ============
# Deleted konnekt.com.au/ubuntu/
# Commented out the old KA8hlalphabet......
# Added repo.konnekt.net.au/repo_current/
# Added repo.konnekt.net.au/repo_test/.
#   repo_test is commented out below, but included so that it can easily be activated using Ubuntu Software Center.
#   The idea is that when we have a new software version to test, we will put it into repo_test and then temporarily
#   select repo_test instead of repo_current in Ubuntu Software Center on a test Videophone.

# KG 10-MAR-16
# ============
# Corrected the old KA8hlalphabet entry - still commented out, but it was wrong.

# KG 05-MAY-17
# ============
# Changed to suit 64-bit on Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04).
# Deleted old KA8hlalphabet completely.
# Added trusted=yes option, to bypass Ubuntu 16.04 stricter auth rules

# KG 03-SEP-21
# ============
# Updated for Lubuntu 20.04 (focal).
